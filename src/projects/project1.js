  title: 'IUPUI Website IA',
  context:
    'IUPUI will be celebrating their 50th anniversary through 2018-2019 and need a website for all celebratory events, stories, and projects. The client requested that the site carry a wow factor with high impact imagery and content that aligns with the school’s commitment to success and innovation in Indiana and beyond. The site’s audience consists of alumni, faculty, staff, students, donors, and the surrounding community. As I was not able to see this project to completion, (due to an unexpected move across the country) I have shared my contributions as a proof of concept.',

  role: 'Information Architect Intern - IU Communications',
  roleSummary: `In order to illustrate what goes into building the site’s architecture from scratch, I have mapped out the process of how information was gathered from stakeholders. 
    The first step was to consult what materials the client had provided with the internal team. We then met with the client to go over their requests for the site to gather context and develop a plan moving forward. 
    In order to understand the proposed website and its context better, a stakeholder workshop was held. From what the client had shared with our team, I created a series of predetermined high-level ideas and wrote them on post-it notes. During the stakeholder meeting, post-its were adhered to the meeting room walls and attendees were encouraged to review these ideas and add more granular pieces of information that they’d like to see under these subject headings. The idea was to show the client this is what we know, and we’d like for them to expand upon it. 
    A discussion was then held where we asked stakeholders what are the most important tasks, messages, and types of imagery they would like to see on the proposed site. 
    From the ideas gathered at the stakeholder workshop, the information architect (myself) and content lead sorted through piles of post-its to tailor the topic and focus of the project. A sitemap was created and presented to the client for approval. At this point I went into the WCMS (IU’s chosen content management system) and developed a high-fidelity wireframe with built out pages. 
    After sharing the wireframe with the client, I met with the front-end developer and designer on the project to discuss interaction design for customized functionalities within the website. Websites at IU are built using atomic design principles where a page is made up of sections and each section can have multiple chunks. All of these elements are built-in to our WCMS. However, when I client wants specific functionality outside of what the WCMS offers, we have to do a bit of customization. In this project, the client wanted a custom events feed to highlight anniversary events as well as an interactive timeline. `,
  lessonsLearned: `This project gave me the opportunity to familiarize with IU Communications’ development process and be part of a collaborative effort. Through my involvement in stakeholder workshops I’ve been able to strengthen my facilitation skills and gain more experience in leading diverse groups. I enjoyed hearing from multiple perspectives and card sorting always provides a great starting point for information architecture. Letting the client know that we were listening to their ideas by constantly reviewing what we know at each share is something I’ll continue to do. 
    With customized features, I was also able to strengthen my knowledge of WCMS capabilities and limitations. Websites created by IU Communications in the IU Framework meet AA WCAG accessibility standards as required by University policy. Creating custom functionality that was visually appealing, met accessibility standards, and easy for the client to maintain moving forward was a top priority in interaction design discussions and will remain a priority of mine.`,
