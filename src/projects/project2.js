  blurb: `Here is where I write small entry text to the project. It shouldn't be more than two sentences. Something like this.`,
  context:
    'IU Corps is a newly formed organization on the IU Bloomington Campus that works to connect students who want to participate in engagement with the people and offices on and off campus who provide such opportunities. While the organization is still in its infancy, the client wanted a website that would introduce the organization to stakeholders to enhance the social, cultural, and environmental impact of community engagement experiences. While the first phase of the site would contain high-level information, the client wanted the site to be scalable for future phases, namely a sorting-house functionality that would connect students with opportunities and help to measure and communicate engagement outcomes.',

  role: 'Information architect intern - IU Communications',
  roleSummary: `In order to understand the proposed website and its context better, a stakeholder workshop was held. Since we had not worked with this particular group before, we wanted to start with introducing our user-centered and responsive website strategy that follows ADA accessibility policies and the IU brand. We then identified primary audiences for the site and began the group exercise.
    The group exercise required stakeholders to break into groups of three and ten minutes answering three questions that were written on easels by writing answers on individual post-its:
    What is the most important information users need to see on the site?
    What are the most important tasks users need to perform when they visit the site?
    What are the benefits of engagement for primary audiences?
    At the end of the ten minutes, groups were instructed to choose their top five answers to each question, and adhere them to the appropriate easel. 
    Next, every stakeholder was given twelve dot stickers and instructed to place one sticker next to their top three answers on that particular question. We then discussed answers with the most post-it at the end of the activity. 
    After the workshop, both the information architect (myself) and the content writer got together to create a sitemap. Once the sitemap was presented and approved by the client, I built out the wireframe in the IU’s WCMS and made recommendations for future scalability.`,
  lessonsLearned: `Since the organization was still forming in the midst of our stakeholder workshop and throughout this project, there were a lot of ideas brought to the table that were sometimes out of scope. This client hadn’t worked with us before and were unfamiliar with how we our development process works. Better explaining our process and defining responsibilities continuously when interacting with stakeholders would help instill trust from our client to know that we know what we’re doing. `,
