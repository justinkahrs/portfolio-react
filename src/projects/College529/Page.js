            The report indicated that users were waffling between three
            different sections in the existing architecture. It was recommended
            to further distinguish content between sections and narrow the scope
            as to prevent information overload on an already intimidating
            subject. A new site architecture was created that simplified the
            subject into distinguishable sections across the site's main navigation.

            Admittedly, going into user testing I hadn't the slightest clue
            about 529 college savings plans. It had to be a quick study. This
            lack of knowledge ultimately helped create the new architecture as I
            thought about how I would break down a subject into simplified
            sections starting with the most basic question, "What is a 529?"
