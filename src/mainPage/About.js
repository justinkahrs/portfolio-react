            As an information architect intern for IU Communications, I work
            with a team to develop seamless user experiences for websites across
            IU. Currently pursuing dual masterâ€™s degrees in information science
            and library science, I focus my coursework in information
            architecture, user-experience design, and front-end development. I
            also hold a bachelors degree in art history from Kendall College of
            Art & Design.

            As a frequent wanderer of the complex
            <a href="https://youtu.be/f99PcP0aFNE">"series of tubes"</a> we call
            the internet, I enjoy doing my part to make things a little more
            easy to navigate, &lt;div&gt; by &lt;/div&gt;.
