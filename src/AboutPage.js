                As an information architect intern for IU Communications, I
                works with a team to develop seamless user experiences for
                websites across IU. Currently pursuing dual masterâ€™s degrees in
                information science and library science, I focus my coursework
                in information architecture, user-experience design, and
                front-end development. I also hold a bachelors degree in art
                history from Kendall College of Art & Design.
